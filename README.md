# Bamazon

Bamazon is like Amazon. This app uses Node and MySql database. To use this app, you need to run npm install to install all the dependencies.  

Initial running of this application will display all of the items available for sale. Include the ids, names, and prices of products for sale. After that, the app then prompt users with two messages.
   * The first ask them the ID of the product they would like to buy.   
   * The second message ask how many units of the product they would like to buy.
   
If the item is not available the user get a response that the item is not availble else the app prompt the second message.
The user then type how many unit of the item they want. If the Unit is the user type is not up to what is int database, the user get a response of 'Insufficient quantity!' else 'Thanks you for using Bamazon'
